# ðŸš€ A2Z DSA Playlist - Solutions
This repository contains my implementation of problems from [Striver's A2Z playlist](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2).
The goal is to build a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms by solving problems in a structured, topicâ€‘wise manner.

# ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a topic in the A2Z playlist.
- Each file contains a selfâ€‘contained solution with comments for clarity.
- Problems are solved in C++ (can be extended to other languages later).

 # ðŸ“Œ Roadmap
- [x] Basics
- [x] Recursion
- [x] Arrays
- [x] Strings
- [x] Linked List
- [x] Bit Manipulation
- [ ] Stacks and Queues
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] DP
(Will keep updating as I progress!)

# ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements
