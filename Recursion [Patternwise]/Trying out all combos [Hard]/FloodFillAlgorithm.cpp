// Problem statement - Coding Ninjas
// Ninja has found his new passion for photography. He has clicked some really good photos but in one of his images, he doesnâ€™t like the color of a particular region. So, he decides to change the color of that region. Can you help him with this task?
// The image is represented in the form of a 2D array of size M * N. Each pixel in the image is a positive integer. Ninja has given you the coordinates (row and column) of a certain pixel and the new color value. You need to replace the color of the given pixel and all adjacent same-colored pixels with the new color.

// Note:
// Two pixels are adjacent if they are connected to each other in any of the four directions: up, down, left, or right.
// Diagonal pixels are not considered adjacent.
  
// Example:
// Consider the image of size 4*4, shown below (left). Let the coordinates of the starting pixel are (1, 2) and the new color is 8. The starting pixel, highlighted with red color, has a pixel value of 3. 
// On replacing the given pixel and all adjacent same-colored pixels with the new color we get the new image, shown below (right). The modified pixels are highlighted with green color.
